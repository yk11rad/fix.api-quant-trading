# fix.api-quant-trading
# Overview:
# This script implements a live forex trading system for GBP/JPY using the FIX 4.4 protocol to connect to a broker’s quote and trade servers. It aggregates H4 candlestick data, detects buy/sell signals based on equal highs and lows, executes trades with realistic slippage and commission, and sends trade notifications via Telegram. The system uses multithreading for quotes, signals, and trading, designed to run continuously in Google Colab.
#
# Usage Instructions:
# 1. Open Google Colab (colab.research.google.com) and create a new notebook.
# 2. Install the requests library if needed: `!pip install requests` (pandas, numpy are pre-installed).
# 3. Set up FIX and Telegram credentials securely:
#    - Replace placeholders (e.g., `QUOTE_HOST = "YOUR_QUOTE_HOST_HERE"`) with your broker’s details.
#    - For sensitive fields (e.g., passwords, account numbers, Telegram token), use Colab’s input prompt, such as:
#      ```python
#      QUOTE_PASSWORD = input("Enter Quote Password: ")
#      TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN = input("Enter Telegram Bot Token: ")
#      ```
#    - Do not hardcode credentials to ensure security.
# 4. Copy and paste this code into a cell and run it using Shift + Enter.
# 5. Monitor outputs: connection status, H4 candle formation, signal detection, trade executions, and Telegram notifications.
#
# Dependencies:
# - Python 3.x
# - Libraries: socket, ssl, datetime, time, pandas, numpy, requests
# - Note: requests may require installation in Colab; others are pre-installed.
#
# Adapting to Your Needs:
# - Update `symbol_id_map` to trade other pairs (e.g., `"EUR_USD": 1`), ensuring correct broker symbol IDs.
# - Modify `pairs_params` to adjust strategy parameters (tolerance, stop-loss, take-profit, etc.) for each pair.
# - Change the trading restriction in `is_trading_allowed` (e.g., remove 21:00–23:00 UTC limit).
# - Customize `detect_signals` for alternative strategies (e.g., different candlestick patterns).
# - Adjust `RealisticExecution` parameters (slippage, spread, commission) to match your broker’s conditions.
# - Update FIX connection details (host, port) if using a different broker or environment.
#
# Notes:
# - Ensure a stable internet connection, as the script relies on continuous FIX server communication.
# - This is configured for a demo environment. For live trading, verify credentials and risk parameters carefully.
# - Multithreading may consume significant resources; monitor Colab’s CPU/memory usage.
# - Telegram notifications require a valid bot token and chat ID; test the bot setup beforehand.
# - The script runs indefinitely until interrupted (Ctrl+C); ensure proper shutdown to close sockets.
# - Contact for support or enhancements (e.g., adding new pairs, strategies, or logging).
